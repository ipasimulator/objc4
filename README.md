# Port of Apple's `objc4` to UWP

## Code organization

In branch `master` is the original code retrieved from [the official Apple's repository](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/objc4/).
The current version there is `objc4-723`.

In branch `port` (most likely this branch) are changes made to the original source code for porting.
One of such change is adding this `README.md` file.
